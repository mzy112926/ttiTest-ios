# ttiTest-ios

*a swift test demo for tti*

#### Problems encountered

Why are there Spaces between SKUï¼Ÿ

>    Because of the space, string need encode(only in swift)
   
Login api need Authorization(fixed).

The key named searchCriteria[pageSize] is so strange.

>     Because of the GET request,the key is concatenated to the URL,this is my first time see [] in url key.


#### Time spent

Drawing the UI took a very small amount of time, about half a day, mainly API debugging,which took a day.
